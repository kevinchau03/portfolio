                    Fast forward to high school: I took my first computer science course in grade 12 and was immediately hooked.
                    Here I am now, a fourth-year computer science student at Western University. I'm most passionate about full-stack development,
                    particularly building web and mobile apps that make a difference.

                    Away from my laptop, I enjoy reading comic books, playing basketball, and self-improvement.
                    I like to live by a japanese word called "Kaizen,". Meaning continous improvement, even if it just 1%.
                    I abide by this rule and look for ways to improve myself everyday.
