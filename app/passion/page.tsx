                    My name is Kevin Chau, an aspiring Software Engineer.
                    My passion for coding started when I discovered a beautiful site called "YouTube to MP3"â€”a godsend for my younger self.

                    Fast forward to high school: I took my first computer science course in grade 12 and was immediately hooked.
                    Here I am now, a fourth-year computer science student at Western University. I'm most passionate about full-stack development,
                    particularly building web and mobile apps from the ground up.

                    Away from my laptop, I enjoy reading comic books, playing basketball, and self-improvement.
                    I like to live by a japanese word called "Kaizen,". By abiding by this rule, I am always looking for 
                    ways to improve myself and my work.
